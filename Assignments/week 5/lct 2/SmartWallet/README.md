**Week 5: Understanding & Applying Account Abstraction (EIP-4337)**

---

## Part 1: Conceptual Questions

### ✅ What is Account Abstraction? How does it differ from the traditional Externally Owned Account (EOA) model?  
**Answer:**  
Account abstraction is an Ethereum standard, like ERC-20, ERC-721, etc. ERC-4337 and EIP-4337 define the Ethereum accounts abstraction protocol. Some of the main features or problems that ERC-4337 solves are that it allows users to have programmable accounts, make transactions for free (without having to pay the traditional gas fees), and recover their account using their preferred social recovery service, like Google OAuth, GitHub authentication, etc.

### ✅ Describe the role of each of the following components in EIP-4337:  
**Bundler, EntryPoint, Paymaster, UserOperation**  
**Answer:**  
These abilities are made possible by the following EIP-4337 components:

- **Bundler(s):** These are off-chain computers (nodes) that process special ERC-4337 transactions known as UserOperations. These transactions await processing in a special environment known as Alt Mempool.

- **EntryPoint:** This is a Singleton Contract that Bundlers send their transactions on behalf of the user’s smart account. It handles the verification and execution logic of the transactions.

- **Paymaster(s):** Paymaster(s) are smart contracts that facilitate free transitions for users. They are charged by the EntryPoint if necessary.

- **UserOperation(s):** This is the transaction submitted and executed on behalf of the user by the Bundler and Entrypoint, respectively. It is not a traditional transaction; it is, instead, a struct that contains the normal fields of a traditional transaction with extra (Fig. 1) fields that conform to ERC-4337.

### ✅ What are the security implications of using smart wallets with custom validation logic? How can developers mitigate risks?  
**Answer:**  
Smart wallets using custom validation logic in ERC-4337 offer flexibility but introduce serious security risks like replay attacks, gas griefing, and logic bugs. Developers can mitigate these by enforcing strict nonce checks, avoiding unsafe external calls, and auditing all validation code. Using trusted libraries and tools like simulateValidation() provided by the EntryPoint also helps ensure safety.

### ✅ Explain how a Paymaster enables gasless transactions. Why is this important for Web3 UX?  
**Answer:**  
A Paymaster in ERC-4337 is a smart contract that sponsors gas fees for users' transactions (called UserOperations). When a user submits a UserOperation, the Bundler calls the Paymaster’s validatePaymasterUserOp() function to check if it agrees to pay. If it returns a valid response and later covers the gas during execution, the transaction goes through, it works even if the user has no gas. Paymaster(s) also allow users with no ETH to pay for gas fees using an ERC-20 of their choice by swapping the ERC-20 for ETH to cover the gas fee.
